# ImageManager
Functional file classifier by date, coded in Javascript, using NodeJS.

This little program receives a directory where there are several files, like images, videos or plain text files. After the execution of the program in that directory, will appear folders named by year of the files that are contained in, and in each folder there are the previous files, named by the date of creation, and a random number between 1 and 1000000 to ensure there is no file overwritten by having the same date as others.

This program only workks in Linux, due to the directory architecture.
